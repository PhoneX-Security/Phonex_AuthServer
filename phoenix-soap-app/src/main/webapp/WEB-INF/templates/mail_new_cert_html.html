    PhoneX certificate has been changed for user <strong><span th:text="${sip}">N/A</span></strong>.
</p>

<p>

<p>
    Certificate is related to the private key that is securely stored in your device and protects your communication (private key never leaves the device). Certificate change means the private key has changed on your device. This may happen on a password change, password reset, application data clean or logging in on a different device. If you change the device, the certificate for previous device becomes invalid.
</p>

<p>
    Your new certificate is being pushed to all your contacts. Their PhoneX application automatically downloads yours newest certificate so they can verify your identity. If your contact is offline, there is a possibility he does not have your new  certificate and all your messages will become invalid. It may take few minutes for your certificate to propagate through the network.

<p>
    If the change was not initiated by you please report this incident to abuse@phone-x.net.
